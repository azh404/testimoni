/**
 * Check whether a plugin marketplace held in a public GitHub repository would
 * synchronize into claude.ai, without connecting or storing it.
 *
 * To check a `.zip` of the marketplace directory instead, use Validate Plugin Marketplace Archive.
 *
 * The report says whether `marketplace.json` is well-formed, which plugins a
 * synchronization would skip and why, and which plugins would synchronize only in
 * part, with some files left out. A repository that is missing, private, or has no such branch or commit is reported, not refused: the response is a report with `valid: false`. Plugin sources outside the marketplace
 * are fetched anonymously from GitHub, so a private one is reported as not found; a
 * source on any other host is not fetched here, and the report notes that it will be
 * checked when the marketplace actually synchronizes.
 *
 * Nothing is recorded on the Compliance API activity feed.
 *
 * For a worked example, see [Validate marketplace content](/docs/en/manage-claude/plugins-api#validate-marketplace-content)
 * in the Plugins API guide.
 *
 * **Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `write:plugins` scope; `read:org_audit` and `read:compliance_org_data` do not grant it.
 *
 * Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.
