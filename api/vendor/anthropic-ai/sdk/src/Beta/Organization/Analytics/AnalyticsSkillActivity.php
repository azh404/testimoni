Apart from that, the names of members' own skills are not disclosed to analytics-key holders. Also null for Anthropic-provided plugin skills (not resolved), for an organization skill or plugin whose name can no longer be found (for example, one since deleted), when `skill_name` is already a display name, or when display-name resolution is not enabled for this organization.
