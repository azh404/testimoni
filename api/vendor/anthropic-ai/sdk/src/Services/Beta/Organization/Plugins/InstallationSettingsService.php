     * List an organization-owned Plugin's installation settings, which say which
     * members it is for, most recently created first.
     *
     * The list holds the Plugin's own organization-wide setting (absent while the Plugin
     * inherits its marketplace's default) and each RBAC Group's own setting. A
     * member-owned Plugin has shares instead, so this path returns 404 for one.
     *
     * **Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `read:plugins` or `read:org_audit` scope, or a Compliance Access Key with the `read:compliance_org_data` scope.
     *
     * Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.
     *
     * @param string $pluginID path param: ID of the Plugin (prefixed `plugin_`)
     * @param int $limit Query param: Number of items to return per page.
     *
     * Defaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `100`.
     * @param string|null $organizationID Query param: For a `read:org_audit` or `read:compliance_org_data` key created for all of a parent organization's linked organizations: a child organization of that parent to read instead of the organization the key was created in, given as the organization's UUID or its `org_`-prefixed ID. A value that is neither returns a 400; an organization that is not a child of the key's parent, or where the Plugins API is not available, returns a 404. Any other key may pass only its own organization's ID here; another organization returns a 404.
     * @param string|null $page query param: Optionally set to the `next_page` token from the previous response
     * @param TargetType|value-of<TargetType>|null $targetType query param: Only settings for this kind of target: `organization` (the organization-wide setting) or `rbac_group` (an RBAC Group's)
